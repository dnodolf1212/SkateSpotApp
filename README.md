The SkateSpotApp is designed to let users log skatespots. Every skatespot can be edited and deleted as needed by any user. Comment's for every skatespot can be logged as well, giving the editing and deleting power only to the creator of a specific comment. Finally, a user can see another user's details (namely their email address and city) after visiting a skatespots comment index.
